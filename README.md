Vulnerability Scanning Lab using Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA)
Scenario
In this lab, I performed vulnerability scans using Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) on a legacy internal server named MS10 hosting Windows Server 2016. Below are the steps and screenshots detailing the process.

Objectives
This lab covers the following CompTIA CySA+ objectives:

Implement vulnerability scanning methods and concepts.
Analyze output from vulnerability assessment tools.
Accessing GSA
Step 1: Start Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA)
Open the Terminal on Kali Linux and type:
sql
Copy code
gvm-start
Wait for the services to start, and the default browser will open with the GSA interface at https://127.0.0.1:9392.
Accept the security risk and log in using the credentials:
Username: admin
Password: Pa$$w0rd.

Configuring a Scan Target
Uncredentialed Scan
Navigate to Configuration > Targets and click New Target.
Name your target MS10, and set the IP to 10.1.16.2.
Save the target.
Screenshot:

Credentialed Scan
Repeat the above steps, but name the target MS10-with-creds.
Under the SMB field, click Create a new credential.
Use structureality\jaime as the username and Pa$$w0rd for the password.

Running the Scan
Uncredentialed Scan
Go to Scans > Tasks, and click New Task.
Name it MS10 Scan - no creds, and select the MS10 target.
Start the scan by clicking the right-arrow next to it.
Screenshot:

Credentialed Scan
Follow the same steps, but name it MS10 Scan with creds and select the MS10-with-creds target.
Start the credentialed scan.

Comprehensive Questions
What port is used by the GSA web UI?

Answer: 9392
What vulnerability scan has the greatest potential to discover system weaknesses?

Answer: Credentialed scan
Conclusion
In this lab, I successfully configured and ran both uncredentialed and credentialed vulnerability scans using GSA. I observed how credentialed scans provide deeper insights into system vulnerabilities compared to uncredentialed scans. Further analysis of the scan reports will help determine necessary security mitigations.
